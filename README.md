# Brownian Motion Tracking
This project takes in a series of .jpg files of polystyrene beads undergoing Brownian motion, identifies and tracks the beads based on depth-first search image processing techniques, and fits the data to Einstein's model in order to approximate Avogadro's number.

## Background
When particles are suspended in a liquid or gas, they seem to move randomly, a phenomenon known as Brownian motion (named after Robert Brown, a botanist who observed this in the early 19th century when tracking pollen particles in water). In 1905, Einstein wrote a paper theorizing that this motion is caused by the collisions these particles have with water (or other fluid) molecules, which in turn he used to prove that atoms in fact exist. This was later verified experimentally by Jean Perrin, who won the Nobel Prize in Physics for his work. In this project, I replicate Perrin's experiment using image processing techniques to measure and track polystyrene beads and fit displacement data to Einstein's mathematical model in order to estimate Avogadro's number (an important constant in chemistry and physics).
